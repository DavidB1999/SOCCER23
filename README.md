# SOCCER23
This repository contains all relevant scripts from the research project **"The Success-Score based on space and ball control - An indicator of playing style and dominance or a success factor?!"** by me David Brinkjans supported by my fellow colleagues.  This project was part of my work at the Institute of Exercise Training and Sport Informatics at the German Sport University Cologne and also my Master thesis. <br>

Feel free to check out the code. <br>

Data not included! <br>
Success-Scores have been calculated via SOCCER© - a match analysis tool developed by Jürgen Perl. <br>

Data handling is done in Python (Jupyter notebooks) entirely. Some of the statistics have been conducted in R due to package / library availability. <br>
Some of the code is based on the brilliant floodlight package developed at the Institute of Exercise Training and Sport Informatics. <br>
If you are interested in sports analytics I would defitley recommend checking it out: https://floodlight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html | https://github.com/floodlight-sports/floodlight <br>

There are two main folders:

*PositionData* - General Data preperation and formating for SOCCER© <br>

*Analysis* - The analysis of the Success-Score data and related variables <br>
