# SOCCER23
This repository contains all relevant scripts from the research project **"The Success-Score based on space and ball control - An indicator of playing style and dominance or a success factor?!"** by me David Brinkjans supported by my fellow colleagues.  This project was part of my work at the Institute of Exercise Training and Sport Informatics at the German Sport University Cologne and also my Master thesis. <br>

Feel free to check out the code. <br>

Data not included! Please be aware that the code does not work without the correct data within a folder structure that resembles the one used within these scripts. An adaptation of the code to similar data should be possible with basic Python skills based on my comments.<br>
Success-Scores have been calculated via SOCCER© - a match analysis tool developed by Jürgen Perl. <br>

Data handling is done in Python (Jupyter notebooks) entirely. Some of the statistics have been conducted in R due to package / library availability. <br>
Some of the code is based on the brilliant floodlight package developed at the Institute of Exercise Training and Sport Informatics. <br>
If you are interested in sports analytics I would definitely  recommend checking it out: https://floodlight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html | https://github.com/floodlight-sports/floodlight <br>

There are two main folders:

*PositionData* - General Data preparation and formatting for SOCCER© <br>

*Analysis* - The analysis of the Success-Score data and related variables <br>

For some context on the project check out my first publication on the Success-Score. I learned a lot since then though :D <br>
