This repository contains all relevant scripts from the research project **"The Success-Score based on space and ball control - An indicator of playing style and dominance or a success factor?!"** by me David Brinkjans.  This project is part of my work at the Institute of Exercise Training and Sport Informatics at the German Sport University Cologne and also my Master thesis. <br>

Feel free to check out the code. <br>

Data not included! <br>
Success-Scores have been calculated via SOCCER© - a match analysis tool developed by Jürgen Perl. <br>
